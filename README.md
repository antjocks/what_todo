#what.Todo

## Overview
[whatsdoin.today](whatsdoin.today)

This is a website I built using Django and HTML and Bootstrap for styling.  

The aim of this website was to create working and secure user authentication using a single multitenant database for object ownership.  

The site itself features a simple todo list where items can be added, completed, and deleted, completed items can be viewed after completion.
